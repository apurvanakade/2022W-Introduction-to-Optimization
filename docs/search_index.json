Linear programs are problems defined as follows. A linear program or a linear programming problem is a problem of the following form: \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} \\mbox{optimize: } &amp;&amp; c_1 x_1 + \\dots + c_n x_n &amp; \\\\ \\mbox{subject to: } &amp;&amp; a_{11} x_1 + \\dots + a_{1n} x_n &amp; \\lesseqgtr b_1 \\\\ &amp;&amp; a_{21} x_1 + \\dots + a_{2n} x_n &amp; \\lesseqgtr b_2 \\\\ &amp;&amp; \\vdots &amp; \\\\ &amp;&amp; a_{m1} x_1 + \\dots + a_{mn} x_n &amp; \\lesseqgtr b_m, \\end{aligned} \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] where the symbol \\(\\lesseqgtr\\) stands for \\(\\leq\\) or \\(=\\) or \\(\\geq\\), \\(a_{ij}, b_i, c_j\\) are real numbers, and \\(x_j\\) are variables. The variables \\(x_1, \\dots, x_n\\) are called decision variables. The linear combination \\(\\zeta := c_1 x_1 + \\dots + c_n x_n\\) is called the objective function. Each of the equalities/inequalities \\(a_{i1} x_1 + \\dots + a_{in} x_n \\lesseqgtr b_i\\) is called a (linear) constraint. Our goal is to either minimize or maximize the objective function subject to the constraints. A proposal of specific values for the decision variables is called a solution. A solution is said to be feasible if it satisfies all the constraints. A feasible solution is said to be optimal if \\(\\zeta\\) attains the optimal value at the solution. Thus, to solve a linear program means to find an optimal solution to the problem. If a problem has no feasible solution, then the problem is called infeasible. If a problem has feasible solutions with arbitrarily large objective values then the problem is called unbounded. Example 1.1 Example of a LP. 1.1 Standard form of a linear program It is difficult to work with a linear program in the form described in Equation (1.1), mainly because of the presence of all three kinds of constraints \\(\\leq\\), \\(=\\), and \\(\\geq\\). A linear program of the following form is said to be in a standard form: \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} \\mbox{maximize: } &amp;&amp; c_1 x_1 + \\dots + c_n x_n &amp; \\\\ \\mbox{subject to: } &amp;&amp; a_{11} x_1 + \\dots + a_{1n} x_n &amp; \\leq b_1 \\\\ &amp;&amp; a_{21} x_1 + \\dots + a_{2n} x_n &amp; \\leq b_2 \\\\ &amp;&amp; \\vdots &amp; \\\\ &amp;&amp; a_{m1} x_1 + \\dots + a_{mn} x_n &amp; \\leq b_m \\\\ &amp;&amp; x_1, \\dots, x_n &amp; \\geq 0. \\end{aligned} \\tag{1.2} \\end{equation}\\] It is useful to think of the objective function as the profit function, the decision variable \\(x_j\\) as the amount of a physical quantity of type \\(j\\), the coefficients \\(c_j\\) as being the profit made from selling a unit quantity of type \\(j\\), and each constraint corresponding to the production of an intermediate quantity. An LP in a standard form can be written more succinctly as follows. \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} \\mbox{maximize: } &amp;&amp; c^T x &amp; \\\\ \\mbox{subject to: } &amp;&amp; A x &amp; \\leq b \\\\ &amp;&amp; x &amp; \\geq 0. \\end{aligned} \\tag{1.3} \\end{equation}\\] where now \\(x\\) is the vector of decision variables, \\(c\\) and \\(b\\) are vectors of real numbers, and \\(A\\) is the matrix of constraint coefficients. This enables us to use tools from Linear Algebra to solve LP problems. 1.2 Converting LP to standard form Notice that maximizing the objective function \\(\\zeta\\) is equivalent to minimizing the negative of the objective function \\(-\\zeta\\). From now on, we will assume that we are always trying to maximize the objective function. Two linear programs LP and LP’ are said to be equivalent if for any feasible solution \\((x_1, \\dots, x_n)\\) to LP, there exists a feasible solution \\((x&#39;_1, x&#39;_2, \\dots, x&#39;_{n&#39;})\\) to LP’ such that \\(\\zeta(x_1, \\dots, x_n) = \\zeta&#39;(x&#39;_1, x&#39;_2, \\dots, x&#39;_{n&#39;})\\) and vice versa. Thus solving LP is equivalent to LP’. Theorem 1.1 Every linear program is equivalent to a linear program in the standard form.
